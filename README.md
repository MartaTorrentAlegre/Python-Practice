# Python-Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created during my coding journey. These scripts demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and practical applications of Python. 

My goal is to develop clean, efficient, and professional-grade code as I work toward mastery of Python and other programming languages.

## Skills and Concepts
- Basic Syntax: `hello.py`. The classic "Hello, World!" program
- Variables and Arithmetic: `variables.py`. Demonstrates variable usage and basic mathematical operations.
- Input and Output: `input_output.py`. Accepts user input and displays interactive outputs.
- Loops and Control Flow: `loops.py`. Includes for and while loops for repetitive tasks and conditional logic.
- Functions and Modularity: `functions.py`. Implements reusable functions for cleaner, modular code.
- Error Handling: `functions.py`. Includes error handling for robust and user-friendly code.
- File Handling: `file_handling.py`. Reads from and writes to files for practical applications.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more scripts to demonstrate advanced Python concepts (e.g., object-oriented programming, data structures).
- Implement small projects like a task manager or text analyzer.
- Refactor existing code to follow clean coding principles.
